A simple router and middleware for region endpoint redirection written in Go.

The motivation for this work is that many DNS-based approaches to region routing rely on GeoIP lookups - operating under
the assumption that the requesting IP will provide a sufficiently robust data point in order to ascertain physical
location. This approach falls short in a number of areas, and further fails to take into account a far more robust
mechanism available to most Edge devices and mobile applications - GPS telemetry. Rather than placing emphasis on the
backend to work out the requesting party's location, we instead take the approach of having the requesting party encode
this information directly in the request headers.

To this extent, `go-region-router` expects to find a [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2] 2-character country code
included on any in-bound request headers that wish to be redirected - accomplished through the addition of a
custom `X-Country-Code` header which specifies the country code denoting where the request originated:

```http request
X-Country-Code: de
```

The extraction of the country code from GPS coordinates on the requesting client side is not handled by this router, but
is possible by any number of reverse geocoding services, including, but not limited to, our [reverse-geocoding-service]
microservice.

The router should also be trivially extendable for [HTML5 Geolocation] support, but as the initial focus of this router
has been for backend routing in response to a moving mobile frontend, this remains to be implemented.

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/adaptant-labs/go-region-router
```

## Usage

### Consul Configuration

Mappings between regions and servers can either be done statically, or dynamically through Consul. In order for the
discovery to work, each server must be tagged with a region identifier (denoted by `region-<code>`), and optionally with
a connection protocol (when the protocol is anything other than HTTPS).

An example service configuration is provided in `docs/consul.d`:

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id":   "apigw0",
      "name": "api",
      "tags": [
        "v1",
        "region-de"
      ],
      "meta": {
        "protocol": "http"
      },
      "port": 80
    },
    {
      "id":   "apigw1",
      "name": "api",
      "tags": [
        "v1",
        "region-at"
      ],
      "port": 443
    }
  ]
}
```

### Starting the Router

Once Consul is up and running and the service definitions are amended with the appropriate data, the router can be
started directly:

```sh
$ go-region-router
2019/07/05 19:20:09 Setting up region routing for [DE] -> http://127.0.0.1:80
2019/07/05 19:20:09 Setting up region routing for [AT] -> https://127.0.0.1:443
2019/07/05 19:20:09 Listening on :7000 ...
```

The following options can be set at run-time:

```sh
$ go-region-router --help

### Using the Middleware

Routing middleware is provided in the `github.com/adaptant-labs/go-region-router/middleware` package. While the
Consul-backed router provides a more elaborate usage example, direct usage of the middleware for establishing static
routes is rather straightforward:

```go
import (
	"github.com/adaptant-labs/go-region-router/middleware"
	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	m := mux.NewRouter()
	r := region.NewRegionRouter()
	r.SetRegionServer("de", "https://de.api.xxx.com")
	r.SetRegionServer("at", "https://at.api.xxx.com")

	// Apply the region routing middleware with default settings 
	http.ListenAndServer(":8080", r.RegionHandler()(m))
}
```
Note that as above, the middleware expects to find the country code in the custom `X-Country-Code` header on in-bound
requests. Requests that do not have this header defined (or for where no matching route is available) will pass through
to the default handler without redirection.

## Online Documentation

Online API documentation is provided through godoc, this can be accessed
directly on the [package entry](https://godoc.org/github.com/adaptant-labs/go-region-router/middleware)
in the godoc package repository.

## Deployment

Docker images are provided under [adaptant/go-region-router][docker], and should be deployed together with a Consul
agent. Information on obtaining and deploying a Consul image can be found on the [Consul Docker page][consul-docker].

Assuming the container with the Consul Agent is running at 172.17.0.2 with port 8500 exposed, `go-region-router` can be
invoked as:

```
$ docker run -d -p 7000:7000 adaptant/go-region-router --consul-agent 172.17.0.2:8500
```
